## Flight and Denial of Asylum 

On April 24, 2024, at the age of 66, I was forced to flee Russia to escape persecution by Russian secret services, whose goal was my physical elimination. However, the persecution continued abroad — in Turkey and Georgia, countries with a massive presence of Russian intelligence agents. 

On September 29, 2024, I applied for asylum in Switzerland, providing evidence of the impossibility of my return to Russia.
However, the processing of my case by the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) of Switzerland was accompanied by gross procedural violations: I was denied an adequate translation of the Interview Protocol, my answers were distorted by the interpreter, my key evidence was ignored by the SEM, and the Decision was based on fabricated circumstances and false "facts." A scheduled medical examination was canceled without explanation. As a result, my asylum claim was groundlessly rejected, and I was deported to Georgia, where I found myself again under persecution, this time amidst a humanitarian catastrophe.

## Survival Conditions 

For almost two years, I, a 68-year-old single woman, have been living in a tent on the street, without access to basic human living conditions:

•	Cold and Heat: In winter, the temperature in the tent drops below zero degrees Celsius. In summer, it rises to 50°C.

•	Lack of Medicine and Hygiene: Impossibility of receiving medical care or any form of treatment (no conditions for storing medication). Impossibility of washing or laundering clothes.

•	Minimal Resources: Nutrition consists of dry rations and cold water. Lack of electricity, heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration. Lack of gas, winter gear, warm clothing, and footwear.

## Systematic Cross-border Persecution 

My situation is not merely a matter of lacking housing, medical care, and adequate living conditions. I am being subjected to constant and systematic cross-border persecution by the Russian secret services:

• Incitement of widespread hatred and hostility among the local population, fueled by slander, insinuations, and fabricated "evidence."

• Assassination attempts disguised as accidents, including deliberate tampering with my bicycle's braking system.

• Infliction of bodily harm, including targeted and systematic attacks on my eyes.

• Intimidation, death threats, and physical violence.

• A targeted campaign of sleep deprivation, utilizing electronic devices placed around my campsite programmed to emit deafeningly loud noises at intervals.

• Deliberate property damage, specifically targeting my tent, air mattress, and bicycle.

• Institutional sabotage within the service sector, involving the intentional sale of substandard or hazardous goods.

• Unprecedented digital terror: the hacking of my smartphone and relentless cyberattacks designed to obstruct my creative work (including the sabotage of AI tools, the destruction or alteration of data, and the creation of persistent technical barriers).

• A heinous act of psychological pressure: the murder of my mother in Russia on October 20, 2025.

## Creativity as Resistance: An Act of Survival and Aid 

The goal of this persecution is simple: to kill me or break me. They want me silent, back in Russia, or dead. That is why I stay vocal. I continue to live and create in spite of everything — the technical hurdles, local hostility, living conditions bordering on torture, psychological warfare, and lack of any medical support.

As a writer, satirist, and artist, my work exposing the war and the Putin regime is blacklisted across all major Russian-language and several international platforms. This total censorship is the ultimate validation of my work; it proves that my words carry ideological weight.

This project is my response to those trying to destroy me. In conditions bordering on inhuman treatment, I create texts to:

•	Expose the relentless tide of political madness, lawlessness, lies, cynicism, and cruelty.

•	Command global attention toward those suffering under authoritarianism and war.

• Mobilize that attention into tangible aid by directing readers to verified support funds for Ukraine.

Every word you read was written under the strain of hunger, cold, constant persecution, and despair.

This is more than literature. It is a testament to an unbroken will,  courage, and active resistance. And simultaneously — a tool to help those like me: the victims, the displaced, and the desperate.
