# ABOUT THE AUTHOR

On April 24, 2024, I left Russia, fleeing physical persecution by the security services. I was subjected to what is known as a "prolonged murder" — systematic poisoning with toxic gases. When I was brought to the brink where death became a clear and imminent prospect, I was forced to leave the country.

On September 29, 2024, I applied for asylum in Switzerland, presenting sufficient grounds for the impossibility of my return to Russia.

However, thanks to the swift intervention of the FSB in the review procedure, with the silent consent and assistance of the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration (SEM), the review process was grossly violated, resulting in my asylum claim being denied. Switzerland allowed the Russian security services to embed their own recruited translator and lawyer into the process, who sabotaged it by deliberately distorting the content of my answers and failing to provide SEM with my written materials and evidence. Switzerland, in turn, violated my rights by not providing me with a legally valid official translation of the Interview Protocol, forcing me to sign a knowingly false document written in French, a language I do not understand.

For over a year since my deportation from Switzerland to Georgia, I have been living in conditions of total humanitarian catastrophe:

*   I live on the street year-round, sleeping in a tent, suffering from the cold, as I cannot afford winter clothing, footwear, or winter gear.

*   I have no access to medicine and am almost always unable to purchase medication due to a lack of proper storage conditions.

*   I am deprived of all, even the most basic, amenities: electricity, heating, access to water, sanitation, a refrigerator, air conditioning, furniture, and so on.

*   I am completely deprived of any hygiene procedures — only store-bought wet wipes. A shower and laundry — once a year. Instead of washing my hair — I shave it off.

*   I am deprived of normal nutrition — replaced by dry rations and icy water, warmed only a few degrees by the heat of my own body.

But all these major and minor hardships and deprivations are nothing compared to the unprecedented, systematic, and continuous persecution I am subjected to, unprecedented in its scale and cruelty:

*   Three hundred sleepless nights in Georgia: artificial nighttime noise is deliberately created near my tent.

*   My bicycle — my only means of transportation — has been completely vandalized: FSB agents regularly puncture the tires, disable the brakes, gearbox, cut cables, and slice plastic ties.

*   My tent and rainfly have been slashed with a knife, my air mattress punctured (since May 13, 2025, I have been sleeping on bare, frozen ground), and the tent frame broken.

*   I have been subjected to verbal threats and direct physical violence.

*   Dozens of attempts have been made to stage road accidents involving me.

*   Attempts to poison me occur regularly in various forms, for example, the tent and rainfly are sprayed from the outside with unknown chemical agents.

*   I constantly face everyday sabotage in stores and pharmacies.

*   To obstruct my creative work, the FSB carries out unprecedented digital terrorism: my phone is hacked and compromised at the firmware level; interference in my work is also ensured through the internet provider: connections are blocked, apps and programs are disabled, data is deleted and replaced, and constant surveillance is conducted.

*   Technological terror: I am systematically prevented from charging my devices, depriving me of access to the most valuable resource — electricity.

But the persecution reached its apogee — cynical and utterly inhuman — on October 20, 2025, when the FSB in Russia killed my mother in an attempt to force me to return to Russia for her funeral.

For my safety, I have built an improvised fence of dry trunks, branches, and sticks around my tent. It is an illusory but my only protection.

The security services persecute and kill "as part of their duty"; holding them morally responsible for it is simply absurd.

But Switzerland, which signed the convention on human rights and committed to providing international protection to those persecuted in authoritarian countries — Switzerland violated its obligations by colluding with the FSB and refusing me asylum. It forced me into an existence on the brink of torture and inhuman treatment — not a life, but a struggle for survival under the harshest conditions, which for a person of my age (68) is tantamount to a slow but inevitable killing.

All responsibility for my death will lie with Switzerland and will cover this country in eternal shame.
