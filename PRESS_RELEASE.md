### Russian Independent Researcher Challenges Global Academic Community to Adopt New Term: "Orthodox Military Putinism"

CITY/LOCATION (Antalya/Tbilisi) 

**Olga Shcheglova, writing under the pseudonym Boris Bidyaga, a Russian opposition writer and queer philosopher, has announced the official publication of her comprehensive study, the "Encyclopedia of Orthodox Military Putinism." The study introduces a rigorous scientific definition to replace the colloquial term "rashism," providing a deeper analytical framework for the current Russian socio-political order**.

### Defining the Threat
"Orthodox Military Putinism" is defined as a 21st-century totalitarian hybrid. It is characterized by the convergence of militant expansionism and the systematic instrumentalization of the Orthodox faith. Unlike previous authoritarian models, this regime relies on a "sacred" justification for war, transforming religious institutions into a pillar of the military-industrial complex.

### A Weapon of Intellect
"The international community cannot defeat a threat it cannot accurately name," says Shcheglova. "Vague political slogans are insufficient for international tribunals or historical record. This Encyclopedia provides the intellectual tools to dismantle the ideological architecture of the regime."

### Key Features of the Study:
**Ideological Mapping**: Detailed analysis of how "war" has been canonized within the distorted religious discourse.

**Totalitarian Control**: Examination of the survival strategies of marginalized groups (including queer communities) under a militarized theological state.

**Digital Preservation:** To bypass state-sponsored censorship and digital manipulation ("The Great Russian Firewall"), the project is permanently hosted on the independent international platform GitHub.

The four editions of the Project are officially registered with ISBNs, ensuring its preservation in international bibliographic databases:

978-5-9903439-3-1 (Russian Edition)

978-5-9903439-4-8 (English Edition)

978-5-9903439-5-5 (French Edition)

978-5-9903439-6-2 (Ukrainian Edition)
