On November 9, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed Decree No. 809 "On the Foundations of State Policy for the Preservation and Strengthening of Traditional Russian Spiritual and Moral Values" (hereinafter referred to as the Putin Decree or the Decree). Source: http://www.kremlin.ru/acts/bank/48502  

It is noteworthy that in the opening lines of the Decree, Putin transitions from the term "traditional spiritual and moral values" to "traditional values," declaring that these two concepts are equivalent in this document. Clearly, this is no accident: such terminology makes it much easier to substitute the original concept. Note that this terminological substitution is present not only in the Decree itself but also in public-political discussions, media, and official documents, where the clarifying term "spiritual and moral" has disappeared from the original phrase, allowing for a broad and free interpretation. And it must be admitted, this was an exceptionally clever move: no one noticed how traditional spiritual and moral values transformed into "traditional values," under whose guise anything can be imposed on the people. In this article, for brevity, we will also sometimes use the term "traditional values," never forgetting that what is meant are traditional spiritual and moral values.  

Let us turn to the Decree. In Section 1, Part 4, Putin defines Russian traditional values as moral guidelines that shape the worldview of Russian citizens, passed down from generation to generation. We fully agree with this definition and will proceed from it.  

Here, Putin also explains what is included in the concept of traditional values:  
Life, dignity, human rights and freedoms, patriotism, citizenship, service to the Fatherland and responsibility for its fate, high moral ideals, a strong family, creative labor, the priority of the spiritual over the material, humanism, mercy, justice, collectivism, mutual assistance and mutual respect, historical memory, and the continuity of generations, the unity of the peoples of Russia.

Of all these, only the following can be considered moral guidelines:  
high moral ideals, the priority of the spiritual over the material, humanism, mercy, justice (as a trait of human character).
All the rest either have no relation to moral guidelines or are only very indirectly related. Moral guidelines are acquired by a person through upbringing (including self-upbringing) and spiritual development. What does Putin offer as "moral guidelines"?  

— Life. But life is given to us by God; how we live it is a separate question, but life itself is not a moral guideline.  
— Dignity. This is a person's self-perception, unrelated to morality. A deeply immoral person can quite easily carry themselves with dignity and feel like a worthy member of society (for example, in a society that encourages immorality).  
— Rights and freedoms. These are granted to a person by the state. Rights and freedoms are not personal characteristics of an individual but the collective will of society regulating the possibility of certain actions (activities) for all its members. Therefore, rights and freedoms cannot be moral guidelines.  
— Patriotism. Love for one's homeland is inherent in most citizens, both highly moral and completely immoral.  
— Citizenship, i.e., awareness of oneself as a citizen of the country and readiness to contribute to the prosperity of society. This is too vague a concept; everything depends on the specific forms of this contribution. If it is successful business, there is nothing highly moral in this activity; if it is, for example, charity, that is another matter. In general, citizenship is not a moral guideline.  
— Service to the Fatherland and responsibility for its fate are also vague concepts. For example, Russian President Vladimir Putin undoubtedly believes that the war against Ukraine is service to the Fatherland and a manifestation of responsibility for its fate. In Putin's opinion, both he himself has served the Fatherland greatly by starting this war, and all those who participate in it in any way (killing the "enemy" at the front, producing shells and guns, or weaving camouflage nets) — all these people demonstrate patriotism, citizenship, and serve the Fatherland. However, any sober-minded person with an objective view of events will agree with me that both the one who started this war and those who participate in it or in any way help its participants are absolutely immoral people because this war is not defensive but aggressive; this war is not an act of defending the Fatherland but an act of aggression against another state. Therefore, it is unacceptable to include "service to the Fatherland and responsibility for its fate" in the category of moral guidelines.  
— A strong family is also not an indicator of high moral ideals; some families are held together by domestic violence; in other "strong" families, the wife tolerates her husband's infidelities. And the strongest families are those where, by mutual consent, mutual adultery flourishes. So a strong family is merely an external form, not necessarily stemming from the highly moral behavior of its members.  
— Creative labor? People work to earn a living for themselves and their family members. This is a necessity. At the same time, a huge number of people do not create anything in their activities, for example, in the service sector, or by trading on the stock exchange, or placing ads on the internet. And the majority of our citizens fully approve of such activities. Any work ennobles a person, but it cannot be said that creative labor is a sign of highly moral behavior. Remember those who "create" tanks and ballistic missiles that kill people in a bloody war. How moral is such labor?  
— Collectivism, mutual assistance, and mutual respect are concepts completely neutral to morality. They are based on the well-known principle: "You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours." There is nothing particularly moral about that. When you help a person without expecting reward or reciprocation — that kind of help becomes a moral act. But helping each other by mutual agreement (even if unwritten) — there is nothing extraordinary about that.  
— Historical memory and the unity of the peoples of Russia have no relation whatsoever to moral guidelines.  
— As for the continuity of generations, in itself it cannot be a moral guideline; it merely serves as a tool for passing accumulated life experience and traditions from generation to generation, including moral norms and principles. But in different families, these norms and principles can be different. Alongside dynasties of talented musicians, there are dynasties of thieves and murderers.  

A logical question arises: why is Putin trying to push patriotism, citizenship, service to the Fatherland, and responsibility for its fate under the guise of spiritual and moral values? To answer this question, let's look at the date of the Putin Decree — 09.11.2022. Recall that on 21.09.2022, Putin announced a partial mobilization in Russia, after which almost a million young men left the country right before his eyes, thus demonstrating their categorical unwillingness to participate in the war against Ukraine. Obviously, Putin realized that this generation was lost to him. Less than a month later, this Decree appears, which directly and unambiguously qualifies participation in the war against Ukraine as a highly moral act. For the war is presented to society in the context of narratives: "The Motherland is in danger," "NATO wants to destroy Russia, to destroy our traditional values," etc. Putin speaks about this quite openly: "It is they [the war participants] — the real, not fake, but genuine elite and pride of the country. The heroism of the warriors defending the vital interests of the country becomes a moral guideline for millions of our citizens..." Thus, the Putin Decree is explicitly aimed at creating a dichotomous ideological construct: those who are against the war and refuse to participate in it are traitors and betrayers of the Motherland, they must be restricted in their rights and imprisoned. Those who support the war, fight, and help the army are conscious citizens, true patriots of Russia, and highly moral individuals; such citizens deserve honor, respect, and glory. These postulates partly affect the adult population but are mainly aimed at the younger generation, from which Putin hopes to make an obedient herd that in the future will meekly go to the slaughter for Putin's "ideals." For Putin does not intend to stop at Ukraine. With Ukraine, he was unlucky: Russian soldiers have weak motivation, hence the very modest successes on the fronts, despite huge losses in personnel and equipment. But when Putin has a one-and-a-half-million-strong army of drilled zombies with brains well-washed by patriotic nonsense — then he will begin to expand his empire on a large scale. No wonder the Putin Decree is called a "strategic planning document in the field of ensuring the national security of the Russian Federation." If we talk about spiritual and moral values in the generally accepted understanding of the term, they are not connected to national security in the slightest, for spiritual and moral values are personal characteristics of a person. But patriotism, citizenship, service to the Fatherland — these are precisely the concepts from which Putin, with the help of his Decree, has made effective levers for drawing the masses into any criminal adventure that he characterizes as "defense of the Fatherland."  

In Part 6 of Section 1 of the Putin Decree, it is stated:  
"Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and other religions, which are an integral part of the Russian historical and spiritual heritage, have significantly influenced the formation of traditional values common to believers and non-believers. A special role in the formation and strengthening of traditional values belongs to Orthodoxy."  

We will not claim anything about other religions, but Orthodoxy has indeed had a huge influence on the formation of the spiritual and moral values inherent in the Russian people. So let us clearly and precisely identify these very Russian traditional Orthodox spiritual and moral values. They are quite unambiguously formulated in recognized religious texts:  

— The well-known 10 Commandments,  
— The Seven Deadly Sins — the antitheses of the seven virtues,  
— The Teachings of Jesus Christ,  
— Some establishments of the Russian Orthodox Church.  

In this article, we want not only to list all Christian virtues — we will try to understand how characteristic they are of modern Russian society. And, above all, for those in power, for it is they who in their decrees and statements, as well as through their propaganda machine, in every possible way describe what excellent spiritual and moral values we have and how they (the Russian authorities) are trying with all their might to preserve, protect, and multiply these values. This means that they should be the first example and model for the common people to follow. This means that they, first and foremost, should be the bearers of these notorious traditional values. Well, let's figure it out and see if this is really the case.  

As Jesus Christ teaches us, the main Christian commandment is: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind." The second most important commandment, similar to the first, is: "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Matthew 22:37-39).  

From this commandment follow several derivative interrelated moral norms.  
First of all, from the 10 sacred Mosaic commandments (Exodus 20:1-17):  
—You shall not murder;  
—You shall not steal;  
—You shall not bear false witness;  
—You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.  

All these commandments are united by one idea — do not harm your neighbor (neither great nor small), even in your thoughts. Closely related in content to the above commandments is the idea of peacemaking — the quintessence of Christian morality. In the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7), Jesus Christ says: "Blessed are the peacemakers..." And further teaches: "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you." "Do not take revenge on someone who wrongs you. If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also." "Anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment." "Anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell."  

In the Christian moral "code," peacemaking holds a crucial place. As we see, Jesus Christ calls for peacemaking at any cost—not only through compromises but also at the cost of self-denial and self-abasement. Recall Leo Tolstoy and his ideology of non-resistance to evil through violence — this idea grew out of the Christian Orthodox religion.  

And now let us turn to the modern policy of the Russian state and the daily practice of Russian state institutions. What catches our eye? Of course, the war against Ukraine. This war is a clear, overt, and unambiguous demonstration of the violation of all the above Christian commandments and moral norms. To begin with, Putin and his associates coveted the national wealth of a foreign country.  

Further. Putin and his propaganda machine lie that this war is a war of liberation, that NATO using Ukraine's hands wants to destroy Russia, that the "conflict" in Ukraine was started by Western elites, that the Russian Federation is the victim in this war, not the aggressor, etc. All this murky verbal stream is not the delirious raving of Putin's inflamed imagination but conscious, politically motivated lies (false witness).  

Putin and his officials, of their own evil will, arranged a monstrous bloody slaughter in Ukraine, in which hundreds of thousands of ordinary Ukrainians and Russians are dying and becoming crippled. At the same time, there were no conflicts or disagreements between our peoples, not the slightest pretext for this war, and there never has been. When the war started, the majority of citizens, both in Ukraine and in Russia, simply could not believe it. But Putin's propaganda has done its job — washed people's brains.  

What Putin and his army are doing in Ukraine, what Putin's propaganda is doing in Russia, is as far from the concept of "peacemaking" as the North Pole is from the South. Putin has set two brotherly peoples against each other, sows hatred and enmity between them, and has been continuing a senseless slaughter and bloodshed for  three years. It is noteworthy that Putin and his military leaders encourage their "warriors" to rob and commit violence against civilians, pursuing a policy of silence and public denial of the crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine. But what is even more disgusting and completely immoral is that decent people who refuse to fight are forcibly dragged to military enlistment offices, taken to the front, and under threat of death compelled to kill Ukrainians. Those who refuse are kept in pits for weeks, in rain and snow, without food or water, subjected to torture and abuse, tried and imprisoned, and often simply killed (as, for example, publicly, during formation, a commander shot 19-year-old conscript soldier Artyom Antonov for refusing to go to the combat zone).  

Similarly, they treat civilians who speak out against the war or tell the truth about the war crimes of the Russian army. These people are subjected to administrative and criminal prosecution!  

That is, not only do Putin and his state bodies conduct a completely immoral, inhuman, unprincipled policy (which has nothing to do with the "traditional values" they proclaim), but they also persecute and destroy people committed to the ideals of humanism and high morality. Since the early 2010s until December 2024, the number of administrative and criminal cases for posts, comments, likes, and photographs on social networks has exceeded 30 thousand. And we recall that Putin's list of Russian "traditional values" includes, among other things, "human rights and freedoms." Meanwhile, the repressive laws adopted after the start of the war blatantly violate these rights and freedoms, primarily freedom of speech. There is no and cannot be any justification for this. Wartime censorship? It can only be applied in those territories where martial law has been declared, and it has been declared only in four occupied regions of Ukraine, yet people are persecuted for personal opinions throughout Russia. A telling case occurred in Tyumen, where nurse Marina Belozerova was fined for the words "Glory to Ukraine," which were found in her personal notebook during a search.  

How does the Orthodox Christian religion evaluate such actions?  

Let us turn to the Gospel of Matthew (18:6-7): "Woe to the world because of things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come!" [i.e., the person who incites (and especially compels) others to sin]. "If anyone causes one of these little ones — those who believe in me — to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."  

But this is exactly what Putin and his numerous advisors and supporters, the Security Council, the Ministry of Defense, the army command, law enforcement agencies, the judicial system, the penal system, and many other departments, as well as, undoubtedly, the Russian propaganda machine, are doing: through these people, "temptation comes" into Russian society. With their lying propaganda and agitation, their repressive laws, their unfair sentences, torture, humiliation, inhuman conditions in prisons and colonies, the practice of pardoning criminals, and finally, promises of huge monetary rewards — Russian citizens are provoked, persuaded, pushed, and compelled to commit a grave sin — the unjustified killing of citizens of a neighboring country, the seizure of foreign territories, robbery, and violence against the peaceful population. And on the other hand, by the same methods, other people who dared to express their critical attitude towards the "triumph" of criminal immorality and the trampling of all human rights and freedoms in the country — these people are subjected to discrimination, imprisoned, tortured, tormented, killed — to force them to abandon their own humanistic views, submit to criminal authority, and fall silent.  

All this devilish (Putin's) host should remember: for them, "it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea" (Matthew 18:6). So great and unforgivable is their sin.  

Putin is the complete opposite of a peacemaker. At his behest, the very word "peace" and its symbols have been banned, and their display is equated with "fakes about the Russian army." Even a foreign citizen (an Italian) was fined for a flag with a white dove and the word "pace," which means "peace" in Italian! The phrase "Peace to the world" is interpreted by Russian justice as condemnation of the so-called "SVO" [special military operation]. Any forms of expression of the very concept of "peace" as the antithesis of war drive the Russian authorities into a state of rage and insanity. Apparently, to survive themselves (politically), the authorities want to plunge Russian society into a state of perpetual war with its neighbors.  

One of the most important moral guidelines of Christian teaching is mercy.  
Christianity emphasizes the transformative power of mercy, calling on believers to forgive their neighbors, as they themselves have been forgiven by God (Colossians 3:13), to show compassion to people as a projection of divine mercy extended to humanity. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus Christ teaches: "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy." And further: "Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you."  

Note that even Putin in his Decree mentions mercy and humanism as part of Russian "traditional values." But how is mercy in real life?  

We have already mentioned the refuseniks at the front who are kept in torturous conditions for weeks or killed and sent into "meat" assaults. Also mentioned were the more than 30 thousand court cases for publications of texts and photographs, likes, and emojis on social networks. Since the start of the war, the number of cases for treason, "terrorism," and "extremism" has increased year by year. At the same time, all these cases are either politically motivated or the security services are simply fulfilling a plan handed down from above to catch spies and traitors. It is completely obvious that the people whom judges send to prison for years and decades do not deserve such harsh punishment, to say the least. Many are accused outright.  

But what is striking is the sadistic cruelty with which Russian judges, on Putin's orders, give huge sentences to the elderly, defendants with serious and even incurable diseases, who simply die in prisons and camps. The daily news about sick prisoners not receiving proper medical care for months is shocking. Cancer patient Igor Baryshnikov was operated on only after his defenders appealed to the UN. Alexei Gorinov, who has severe chronic illnesses, was kept in inhuman conditions for a long time, and after the second verdict was issued, the heating in his cell was turned off and his warm blanket was taken away. Teenagers are mercilessly sentenced to years and put in prisons and colonies. Fifteen-year-old Arseny Turbin was sentenced to five years for leaflets against Putin. At the same time, the young man did not admit his "guilt" and firmly insists that he distributed the leaflets on his own initiative, not on the instructions of an "extremist organization." Sixty-eight-year-old Nadezhda Buyanova was sentenced to 5 years in a colony not even for her own opinion but for stating a well-known fact: soldiers participating in the war, on both sides, are legitimate military targets for each other. An old person, a woman, a practicing doctor, was put in prison for 5 years! Truly, Putin's judges are not judges but bloodthirsty executioners. No, not even executioners. An executioner is, though cruel, a profession. But Putin and his so-called "justice" are sadists who take pleasure in the sight of human suffering. And Putin's prisons and camps? The Russian authorities call them "correctional" institutions. Is this how you "correct" people — with torture, torment, abuse, hunger, cold, deprivation of basic comforts, violation of basic rights (to medicine, to a warm room, to normal food)? No, this is not "correction"; this is how you show a complete lack of empathy, pity, compassion, and mercy towards people; these moral guidelines in Putin's "community" are not even at zero but at minus infinity. On the topic of mercy, we add the numerous reports of Putin's soldiers killing unarmed Ukrainian prisoners, acts of violence against the civilian population, and in general the attitude of the Russian command towards personnel as cannon fodder.  

We advise Putin and the community of his apologists and like-minded people not to forget the saying of one of the pillars of Christian teaching: "Judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful" (James 2:13).  

Christianity is extremely negative towards such a vice as hypocrisy. In the Sermon on the Mount, Christ said: "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?" (Matthew 5-7).  

But how are things in this area with our president and his henchmen? Things are bad, very bad. For example, the regime of Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been publicly and nationally branded as Nazi, and Ukraine as a militaristic state posing a threat to Russia's national interests. But the fact that Putin himself has turned Russia into a militaristic state based on a fascist dictatorship — this Putin and his community categorically refuse to admit. And just the other day, Russian Foreign Minister S. Lavrov in an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson stated literally the following: "We have no intention of destroying the Ukrainian people. They are brothers and sisters of the Russian people." Meanwhile, according to UN data, since the start of the Russian invasion (2014), the population of Ukraine has decreased by 10 million people, and in the hot phase of the conflict (since 24.02.2022) alone, over 12 thousand civilians have been killed. And how much collateral damage has been caused to our Ukrainian "brothers and sisters"! Homes destroyed to the ground, mutilated bodies, lives, fates, loss of loved ones, stress, despair, physical and moral suffering... And thousands of square kilometers of mined Ukrainian land where it is impossible to walk without risking one's life and limb? To return Ukraine to normal life, billions of dollars and decades of painstaking labor will be required! Without comprehensive material, technological, and human help, it is simply unrealistic to accomplish this task. Only a person who hates them with a fierce hatred can treat "brothers and sisters" like this.  

And Putin's propaganda spreads its delusional fabrications through minds, implanting false and dangerous attitudes in the public consciousness. With its warlike reckless rhetoric, Putin has exacerbated the situation to such an extent that the democratic community is trumpeting in unison that Russia has become an existential threat to the whole world. And Putin's propagandists persistently and methodically drip on our brains that Russia is a victim of the machinations of the "collective West," that the war in Ukraine is part of the struggle for Russia's "freedom and sovereignty." Having originated at the very top of Russian power, this godless hypocrisy, like metastases, spreads wide and deep; it has affected the entire Russian society to its foundation.  

In the Sermon on the Mount, Christ tells his disciples: "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth." "No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money" (Matthew 5-7). Of course, a person needs money — to live, eat and drink, clothe themselves, have spiritual food, raise children, etc. But Christianity condemns people who have an unjustified passion for wealth and crave money for money's sake. Well, what does Russian society think about this?  

The entire Russian government, from Putin to the lowest levels, is obsessed with the idea of wealth and enrichment. This prompts officials of all ranks to take bribes, embezzle the budgets of the country and regions, deceive, and profit at the expense of others. Most of the wealth of those in power is acquired criminally. And at the top of this pyramid of rich robbers of their people proudly sits Putin, considered the richest man on the planet. Following the example of the ruling stratum, the consciousness of the common people has also been formed. In Russia, wealth is a fetish worshipped by the majority. In Russia, wealth is a goal that the majority strives for. In Russia, wealth is a universally recognized measure of success and life achievements. People invent new ways to get rich; with the advent of the internet and social networks, a real revolution has occurred in this area. Now every blogger with any audience enriches themselves — on advertising, on donations. A huge number of online services are sold on the internet. Without leaving home, you can trade on the stock exchange and currency rates. People do not need the kingdom of God; they are much more attracted to the "earthly paradise," which opens its doors to them if they have a large amount of money. Meanwhile, returning again to the Putin Decree, we see that he included "the priority of the spiritual over the material" in the concept of "traditional values." Unfortunately, according to this indicator, Russian society, and even more so the Russian government, again find themselves deeply in the negative.  

In Christian teaching, a special place is occupied by pride. What does this word mean?  
Christ began his Sermon on the Mount with the words: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5-7). The poor in spirit are humble people, contrite in heart (aware of the weight of their sins). The moral opposite of the poor in spirit is a person consumed by pride. Pride is exaggerated self-conceit, self-confidence, consciousness of one's own infallibility, self-worship. A person consumed by pride considers themselves superior to all other people. Everything they have achieved in life, they consider their personal merit. Holy Scripture contains warnings about the dangerous consequences of pride. The Book of Proverbs says (16:18–19) that "pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall."  

And indeed, it is pride that underlies moral degradation. Take Russian total official corruption. Without a doubt, it is provoked by an insatiable thirst for money and wealth, but the moral foundation for corruption is created precisely by pride. Embezzling budgets at all levels, shamelessly robbing one's country and its citizens, whose taxes, in fact, make up the state budget, is allowed by officials due to a sense of superiority over ordinary people, whom functionaries endowed with high positions consider cattle and a lower caste. This is one of the worst manifestations of pride — a kind of self-worship, from which permissiveness stems.  

Recall that until recently, in the main church of the Russian Armed Forces, in the wall mosaic, the "sacred images" of the President of the Russian Federation V. Putin, former Minister of Defense S. Shoigu, Speaker of the Federation Council V. Matvienko, Speaker of the State Duma V. Volodin, and Director of the FSB A. Bortnikov were immortalized. This is no longer even self-worship but self-deification, self-sacralization, which borders on blasphemy. The fake "triumphant" elections are not enough for Putin; he wants to be in the eyes of the electorate a "messenger of God on earth."  

Pride truly drags people into the abyss. It, like a snowball rolling down a mountain, accumulates ever new and more reckless and sinful actions. Now Putin and his ilk have imagined themselves to be almost gods, having the power to dispose of the fates and lives of millions of people around the world: Georgia, Ukraine, Syria, Africa, South America... I'm not even talking about Russia — the Russian population has long had the status of despised serfs and disenfranchised slaves in their eyes. But they don't stop there. Now Europe and the USA are suffering from aggressive actions by Putin's gang: sabotage at factories, infrastructure facilities, and transport, destructive cyberattacks, incitement of panic and discontent, interference in electoral processes... Permissiveness, grown on the soil of pride...  

Quite frankly, clearly, and precisely, M. Piotrovsky, director of the state Hermitage, a major functionary of the Russian state sphere of culture and art, a convinced supporter of Putin and the war in Ukraine, recently awarded the order "For Merit to the Fatherland," defined the internal motives of Russian aggressive policy. Justifying the bloody slaughter unleashed in Ukraine, Piotrovsky publicly stated that war is "the self-assertion of a nation. And this is normal, for every person has a desire for self-assertion".
Primitive savagery and extreme cynicism, grown on the soil of pride...  

The next item of Putin's "values" is family and marriage. In his Decree, he calls this a "strong family." In Christian teaching, this concept is absent. Christianity speaks of the inadmissibility of adultery (marital infidelity) and the indissolubility of marriage. Marriage is a sacred union, concluded in Heaven, a union until death. Cohabitation outside of marriage is also adultery, life in sin. Let's see how things are in Russian society with this.  

First, in 2013, Putin divorced his wife, Lyudmila Putina, violating Christian law. After that, he got together with Alina Kabaeva but did not marry her legally; and has been living with his "partner" in sin for many years and even has two children with her. Where is the Christian morality here? Where is the strong family? According to Christian canons, there is no family here at all, but only sin, fornication, and illegitimate children. This is the example the head of state sets for the population.  

And what about the population itself? According to statistical reports, over the past 10 years, Russians have been marrying less often, and the number of divorces has reached a record figure: in 2023, for every 10 marriages, there were 7 divorces. So a "strong family" is not about Russia. Christian regulations concerning family and marriage are not observed in Russia. Citizens live in civil marriages, divorce, commit adultery, and such actions are not condemned by society.  

Thus, Christian virtues such as mercy, humility, compassion, and righteousness are not simply absent in the Russian political elite but are grossly trampled upon. The entire system is built on lies, hypocrisy, cruelty, and the desire for enrichment at any cost. The Putin regime parasitizes on religious rhetoric, substituting true spiritual values with propaganda clichés.  

The only two points in which Putin and his ideologists seem to have approached Christian morality are their negative attitude towards abortion and the LGBTQ community. But here we should understand the true motives of these new Putin ideological "zigzags."  

Christianity condemns abortions because abortion is considered murder; thus, abortion violates one of the main Christian commandments — "You shall not murder." The sin of abortion is supposed to be atoned for by 25 years of prayer. As we see, Christianity shows a humanistic approach to the issue of abortion. Putin, however, "suddenly remembered" abortions after the irrecoverable losses of the Russian army in the Ukrainian slaughter exceeded half a million people. Plus, against the background of Russian internal instability and a collapsing economy, the birth rate in the country has catastrophically fallen, reaching its historical minimum in 2024 — 599.6 thousand children in the first half of the year. Plus, there are justified fears that at least several million Russian men will not fight Ukrainians and in case of mobilization will either leave, or hide, or become refuseniks, or surrender at the first opportunity. Meanwhile, Putin needs reinforcements, new soldiers — good soldiers, with "correct," patriotic upbringing. So the issue of abortions arose in Russian political discourse not out of pity for killed human embryos; these embryos will die anyway, one way or another, but first they must be born, turned into an obedient and well-drilled army of soldiers, and sent by Putin's clique to conquer neighboring countries and peoples. As we see, Putin, on the issue of abortions, unlike Christianity, shows an anti-humanistic and purely utilitarian, cannibalistic approach.  

As for the dislike of LGBTQ, it seems that the LGBTQ community simply came under Putin's "hot hand." Putin has been in power since 2000, and until recently, the state's attitude towards the LGBTQ community was tolerant. But after the start of the war in Ukraine, a new trend emerged in the Russian political field: to look for enemies everywhere, to ban everything, to multiply lists of foreign agents, terrorists, and extremists — first, to channel the growing discontent of the crowd in the right direction. And on the other hand — to keep the people in a state of perpetual fear and obedience with continuous repressions. There is nothing in common with the Christian approach in Putin's "dislike" of LGBTQ. Christianity considers homosexual relations a sin and sodomy, while Putin and his ideologists have nothing against homosexual relations as such but have declared so-called "propaganda" of LGBTQ relations a crime. As we see, the difference in approaches is colossal. Moreover, all talk about "propaganda" of LGBTQ is generally meaningless because propaganda can only have an effect on the human mind if a person has the possibility of conscious choice. A person does not choose their sexual orientation — sexual orientation stems from their nature. No propaganda can turn a heterosexual into a homosexual. Obviously, the Russian law banning LGBTQ propaganda is just another pretext for mass repressions.  

The Putin government uses the LGBTQ community as a convenient "enemy," distracting society from real problems. This is not care for morality but banal political manipulation.  

So these two threads also do not connect Putin's traditional quasi-values with Christian teaching.  

Thus, we have found that Putin and Russian power structures, as well as a significant part of Russian society, do not follow Christian norms of morality and ethics in their activities and daily life in the slightest. Moreover, these people are mired in the most shameful, most blasphemous, most disgusting vices inherent in unbridled human nature. Putin's statements that Russia protects and multiplies traditional spiritual and moral values are blatant lies and cunning manipulation. Russia is in spiritual and moral decline; Russia has mercilessly destroyed the Christian moral foundations historically established in society (in the pre-revolutionary era); as "moral guidelines," Russia has chosen for itself mafia "concepts," barbaric customs, and laws of the bandit alley.  

However, history shows that regimes based on lies and violence are doomed to collapse. And when this happens, all hypocrites, criminals, and their accomplices will stand trial — if not before an earthly one, then before the Supreme One.
